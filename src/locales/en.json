    "title": "Rendering My Story",
    "paragraph1": "I got into the world of development after working in other fields, and since then I’ve discovered that programming gives me the freedom to create things from scratch. I’ve always loved technology — I just needed that final push to dive in completely.",
    "paragraph2": "I enjoy spending hours coding, learning, and solving problems. I’ve learned that mistakes are part of the process: every bug I’ve fixed has taught me to become a better developer. When something doesn’t work, I don’t stop until it does — and I love that moment when everything finally clicks. I believe that mindset is what drives me to keep growing and improving with every project.",
